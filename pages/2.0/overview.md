## What is Avalon?

Avalon is the data pipeline between persons, applications, file systems and database as content is created.

It sits right inbetween organisational concerns such as scheduling and budgets, and operating systems related issues such as dependencies and user authentication, with some overlap into each.

It overlaps into people management by hooking into tasks supplied via production tracking systems such as ftrack and Shotgun, and into the OS by writing to protected areas via web services.
