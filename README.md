### Avalon Documentation

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/getavalon/docs.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/getavalon/docs)

Project documentation for [avalon](https://github.com/getavalon/core), automatically tested and deployed to [getavalon.github.io](https://getavalon.github.io).

### Contributing

If you find anything wrong with this documentation, you are invited to improve upon it and here's how you can do that.

**Prerequisites**

Making changes or additions to Avalon's documentation can come in 1 of 2 forms.

1. Make a change to any page under [pages/](https://github.com/getavalon/docs/tree/master/pages/2.0), and submit a pull-request (PR)
2. Edit and preview each change interactively on your local machine, and then submit a pull-request.

Previewing the documenation prior to submitting a PR is preferred, as it would enable you to actually see what you're doing prior to submitting it for review; this works on a Windows, Mac or Linux, with Docker available.

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/getavalon/core avalon-core
$ set AVALON_CORE=%cd%\avalon-core       # cmd
$ $env:AVALON_CORE="$(pwd)\avalon-core"  # powershell
$ export AVALON_CORE=$(pwd)/avalon-core  # bash
```

Set the environment variable using your shell of choice, either `cmd,` `powershell` or `bash`.

**Usage**

Next we'll build and run the image. This will host the documentation locally, via [mkdocs](https://github.com/mkdocs/mkdocs), and monitor changes you make to any markdown page. Once you've run it, you'll notice a new directory having been created called `build/`. This is what `mkdocs` sees and previews for you, it is the result of pre-processing (see below for what exactly it is doing and why).

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/getavalon/docs avalon-docs
$ cd avalon-docs
$ .\build_docker

Now visit http://localhost:8000 to view the resulting documentation. Any changes you make to the [pages](https://github.com/getavalon/docs/tree/master/pages/2.0) markdown files are reflected in this location in real-time. For each edit, here's what happens.

1. Each markdown page in `pages/` is built into `build/`
1. Each markdown page in `build/` is converted into HTML into `site/`
1. Any code snippets are executed and their results are included into the built markdown
1. Any references, such as to schemas, are read and converted into markdown

### Theme

The theme is built with mkdocs and based on [squidfunk/mkdocs-material](https://github.com/squidfunk/mkdocs-material), with some changes and additions.

- [Versioning](#versioning)
- [Placeholder Expansion](#placeholder-expansion)
- [Living Documentation](#living-documentation)
- [Tabbed Code Snippets](#tabbed-code-snippets)

<br>

#### Versioning

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2152766/27929857-85a49c02-628c-11e7-8137-43e38b46f4ce.png)

For each version of Avalon, a new series of pages are made such that each version may be documented in full without a newer version overshadowing an older one.

<br>

#### Placeholder Expansion

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2152766/27930013-0d1051ae-628d-11e7-872d-d1e380815f48.png)

Placeholders are added where live code is injected at build time. This ensures that reference material, such as schemas, is never out of date and tell you when there is anything amiss, such as missing example material.

```md
{{schema:subset-2.0.json}}
```

<br>

#### Living Documentation

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2152766/27930040-2054f1b6-628d-11e7-9fa2-e48af19a63c3.png)

Every Python snippet in this documentation is executed during build, including interactively as you edit the documentation on your local machine. The results of the execution is included into the documentation itself.

This ensures that no example code carries any errors and is up to date with the actual code it is referring to. It's also handy to know whether the code you write actually runs!

<br>

#### Tabbed Code Snippets

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2152766/27930170-85520f0e-628d-11e7-99fb-33cd75abf3d5.png)

As Avalon is cross-platform, it's important that each OS-specific snippet of code is compatible with your favorite platform. The documentation includes tabs for such occasions. Additionally, changing one tab automatically changes all other tabs, as it is assumed you are only ever interested in snippets for a single platform at a time. For convenience, the active tab as you read is based on your current OS, such as Windows or Linux.
